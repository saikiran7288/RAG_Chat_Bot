🚀 RAG Chatbot with FLAN-T5-Base & Chroma DB 🤖

This repository contains a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot powered by the FLAN-T5-Base language model from Google! 🌟 It's designed to answer questions by first retrieving relevant context from a document and then generating accurate and informative responses using cutting-edge language models. 💬

🔥 Key Features:


FLAN-T5-Base Model: A robust and advanced text generation model from Google that ensures high-quality responses. 🧠

Chroma DB: A powerful vector database for storing document embeddings, making it easy to retrieve and retrieve relevant information based on your query. 📂🔍
Sentence-Transformers: Embedding model used to generate dense vector representations of text chunks for efficient retrieval. 🗣️


💾 Technologies Used:

LLM: Google’s FLAN-T5-Base model for text generation. 🌐

Chroma DB: Fast and reliable vector database for storing and querying embeddings. ⚡

PyMsy: For storing chat history. 💬

Sentence-Transformers: For embedding and vector representations of text. 🔢

🔄 Workflow:

PDF Processing 📄: Text is extracted from a PDF document and preprocessed to remove unwanted spaces, tags, and special characters. 💻

Embedding 🧳: Chunks of cleaned text are converted into vectors and stored in Chroma DB for efficient retrieval.

Question Answering 🎯: A user can ask a question, and the chatbot will retrieve relevant context from the document, then use FLAN-T5-Base to generate an accurate answer. 💡

⚙️ Example Usage:

Question: "What is the main concept of RAG?"

Answer: The chatbot retrieves relevant text from the PDF and provides a concise, accurate response generated by FLAN-T5-Base.
